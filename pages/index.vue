      This is a test app for Nuxt 3. I made this to get a feel for Nuxt 3 and
      all of the features and best practices. The app makes use of real rest
      API's through the use of the useFetch hook, and also server api handling
      for more sensitive api data using $fetch and environment variables.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      The app also makes use of Tailwind CSS, and the new vue composition API. I
      would like to note that due to using free API's the fetching of data may
      be slow at times, and this is not indicative of the performance of the
      app.
